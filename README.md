# Homunculus - a Formant Synth Plugin (JUCE, GPL3)#

Homunculus is a free and open source synth based on a very simplified model of the human voice. A band limited impulse train models the glottal pulses of the vocal cords, and a bank of resonant filters models the shape of the mouth. While this synth can create sounds that are human, it is capable of producing a range of sounds.

## Using homunculus ##



## Installation ##

Coming soon.

## Motivation ##

I wanted to learn JUCE, general prinicples of software architecture, and some DSP (Blit and filtering). While I have a ways to go, I did not have the heart to let this languish on my hard drive. It's too spunky.

## Compiling from source ##

This code requires [JUCE](https://shop.juce.com/get-juce) be installed. It is also recommended that one uses the Projucer that comes with the software.

One should be able to simply open homunculus.jucer with the projucer. From there, one should be able to open the default IDE and compile from there. This has not been tested extensively.
